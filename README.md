# TouchView

Pan, rotate, and zoom the viewport with touch or pen input. TouchView overlays configurable control zones and a customizable gizmo bar on top of Blender, making it comfortable to use without a keyboard or mouse.

## Features

- **Viewport touch control** - three configurable hot regions: drag the middle to pan, either edge to zoom, and the remaining space to rotate
- **Pen and finger together** - the pen keeps drawing while your finger (or mouse) controls the camera
- **Control-zone overlay** - a toggleable, colorable overlay showing each control region; fade it out or disable it once you know the layout
- **Swap Pan/Rotate** - swap the pan and rotate regions; with rotation locked, pan anywhere between the zoom edges
- **Custom double-tap** - finger or click double-tap triggers Transfer Mode, Toggle Touch Control, Toggle Local View, or Toggle Full-screen; the pen never triggers it while drawing
- **Custom on-screen buttons** - Undo/Redo, Fullscreen, Quad-view, Recenter, Rotation Center, N-panel, Rotation Lock, Topology Control, and Sculpt Brush Dynamics, each toggleable from the overlay menu
- **Topology control** - retopology tools in Sculpt Mode; switches to subdivision-level controls when the object has a Multires modifier, with a configurable subdivision limit
- **Sculpt brush dynamics** - brush size and strength from the viewport in sculpt and paint modes
- **Floating action menu** - assign up to 8 commands per edit mode and drag it anywhere; disable it if you don't need it

### Roadmap

- **Better 3D gizmos for edit mode** - replace the icon bar in Edit Mode with interactive 3D gizmos so extrude, bevel, loop cut and similar tools are reachable from the viewport
- **Control gizmo cycle** - let the on-screen control button flip through the object transform gizmos and the sculpt-mode gizmos (mask, face sets, and so on)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release zip (`touch_view_vX.Y.Z.zip`) from the [releases page](https://github.com/b3dhub/touch_view/releases).
2. In Blender, open `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons` (or `Get Extensions` on Blender 4.2+), click the top-right dropdown, choose `Install from Disk...`, select the zip and enable **Touch Viewport**.

> **Not showing up or no input?** Search the Add-ons list for **Touch Viewport** (the add-on name and sidebar category differ) and make sure it is enabled. On Linux, run Blender through X11/XWayland (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY= blender`) - Blender's native Wayland backend does not forward tablet or touch events to add-ons.

## Usage

TouchView overlays three control regions on the viewport. By default the pen draws while your finger or mouse drives the camera; change the routing with **Input Mode** in the preferences. Settings live in **3D Viewport > Sidebar (N-Panel) > Touchview**.

Every on-screen button can be toggled on or off from the overlay menu.

The floating action menu holds up to 8 custom commands per edit mode and can be dragged anywhere in the viewport.
